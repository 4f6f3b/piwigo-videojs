* Ensure your server is using the correct mime-types. Firefox will NOT play the Ogg video if the mime-type is wrong. Place these lines in your .htaccess file (in Piwigo root directory) to send the correct mime-types to browsers

AddType video/ogg  .ogv
AddType video/mp4  .mp4
AddType video/webm .webm

* Some web hosts, in trying to save bandwidth, gzip everything by defaultâ€”including video files! In Firefox and Opera, seeking will not be possible or the video may not play at all if a video file is gzipped. If this is occurring to you please check your server / hosts and disable the gzipping of Ogg and other media files. You can switch off gzipping for video files in your .htaccess file by adding this line:

SetEnvIfNoCase Request_URI \.(og[gv]|mp4|m4v|webm)$ no-gzip dont-vary';
